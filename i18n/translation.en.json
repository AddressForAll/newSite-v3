			"text":"As part of their work supporting the collaborative map project OpenStreetMap, for 3 years the founders of the Institute tried to motivate the Brazilian government to create an open and collaborative address database in Brazil. Seeing that the project did not go beyond ideation due to lack of political will or strength, Thierry Jean, Filipe Rocha and Peter Krauss decided to launch the \"AddressForAll\" project in 2020 and created a non-profit association called \"Geo-Social Technologies AddressForAll Institute\"."

Entretanto, apontar um local no mapa é necessário para todos, particularmente para lugares onde não tem endereços de qualidade, como nas comunidades, nos desertos, nas savanas etc… Geocódigos são códigos mais fáceis de lembrar, particularmente se desenvolvermos geocódigos mais curtos. Este projeto realiza uma pesquisa acadêmica para desenvolver a melhor tecnologia de Geocódigo e leva‑la para os governos e a sociedade. Esta tecnologia deveria levar em conta e ser harmonizada com as grades estatísticas, porque os estudos estatísticos, cada dia mais, são geo‑espaciais."

We have a team that calls data holders and motivates them to donate their data to the AddressForAll project, with free licenses. We do active advocacy work for open data and teach governments how to publish their data in the public domain with the CC0 license which is the most appropriate. \n\n We can make specific campaigns in regions or countries, on demand of a sponsor, however the result of the work is open to everyone. If your company leverages data from the AddressForAll Institute, please contact us to contribute financially to this effort so that the project can grow.\n <h2>Services for governments:</h2>\n Sometimes governments wish to orchestrate an open address database project on their territory, but lack the budget, organizational structure or expertise to do so. These governments can contract the AddressForAll Institute to organize and operate the project in their country.\n\n The development of the project may lead to the proposal of new laws improving the management of addresses, as we have seen in France or Uruguay, for example."

Even if you consider the data unreliable, when cross-referencing it with other data, it can help a lot in the final quality of the work. .\n\n Data yielded do not necessarily have to be from addresses. When we receive orthophotos or complete map files, we will try to make this data available to the OpenStreetMap community to make your work of mapping the world easier.\n\n If you would like to be an Ambassador for the AddressForAll project in your region or industry, there is a lot you can do to help us build an excellent open address base.\n <h2>OR</h2>\n If you would like to share your impressions and tips on how we can constantly improve, please contact us.
